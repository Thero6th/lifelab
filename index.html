        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>This non-profit organization has been formed to educate those that seek to learn more about Hip hop's many different dance forms; specifically breaking. Breaking has evolved since its discovery. Since the early 1970's, breaking had always consisted solely of just the moves themselves. It began in the South Bronx and the Harlem area of New York City. Breaking was a form of fighting within a dance. It has now become a sport and has reached its influence internationally. </p>
